# single-file-projects

These are some of the quick small projects that i wrote of varing quality and cleanes of code. But I think some are cool.
Many were inspred by maths stuff I saw in videos from Numberphile, 3Blue1Brown, Mathologer and others more specifc video 
links will be in the descriptions below.

<b> Chaos Game </b>
