# single-file-projects

These are some of the quick small projects that i wrote of varing quality and cleanes of code. But I think some are cool. Many were inspred by maths stuff I saw in videos from Numberphile, 3Blue1Brown, Mathologer and others more specifc video links will be in the descriptions below.

# Desciptions

<b> Chaos Game </b>

Inspired by the numberphile video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs,
but with additional bits and bobs.

<b> Circle Dot </b>

Combination of points moving in a sin path at different angles as well as at different rates creating intersting motion

<b> Hilbert's Curve </b>

A demonstration of Hilbert's space filling curve. You can step through the itterations by pressing <a>.

<b> Decoding Romans </b>

A program for encrypting and decrypting text by a simple character shift. It works by producing all possible combinations.

<b> Loading </b>

It's a loading bar. It does not stop...

<b> Toothpicks </b>

A simple rule set of placing down toothpicks creating a nice pattern. The rule is that tootpicks must be placed on the ends of other toothpicks if there is space and that defines the next itteration in the pattern.

<b> Traveling Salesman problem</b>

The program solves the Traveling Salesman problem by brute forcing every combination through lexograthic order. The program displays current attempt by purple and best attempt so far by green. A random set of points is generated each time.
