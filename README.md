# Mini Projects

This collection encapsulates an array of my smaller-scale projects, exploring invigorating ideas from different areas of mathematics. Although these projects are old, they mean a lot to me. As in writing these programs, I found the love for code that follows me to this day.

## Descriptions

### Chaos Game

Inspired by the numberphile video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs,
but with additional bits and bobs.

### Circle Dot

Combination of points moving in a sin path at different angles as well as at different rates creating intersting motion

### Hilbert's Curve

A demonstration of Hilbert's space filling curve. You can step through the itterations by pressing <a>.

### Decoding Romans

A program for encrypting and decrypting text by a simple character shift. It works by producing all possible combinations.

### Loading

It's a loading bar. It does not stop...

### Toothpicks 

A simple rule set of placing down toothpicks creating a nice pattern. The rule is that tootpicks must be placed on the ends of other toothpicks if there is space and that defines the next itteration in the pattern.

### Traveling Salesman problem

The program solves the Traveling Salesman problem by brute forcing every combination through lexograthic order. The program displays current attempt by purple and best attempt so far by green. A random set of points is generated each time.
