# single-file-projects

These are some of the quick small projects that i wrote of varing quality and cleanes of code. But I think some are cool.
Many were inspred by maths stuff I saw in videos from Numberphile, 3Blue1Brown, Mathologer and others more specifc video 
links will be in the descriptions below.

# Desciptions

<b> Chaos Game </b>

Inspired by the numberphile video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs,
but with additional bits and bobs.

<b> Circle Dot </b>

Combination of points moving in a sin path at different angles as well as at different rates creating intersting motion

<b> Hilbert's Curve </b>

A demonstration of Hilbert's space filling curve. You can step through the itterations by pressing <a>.

<b> Decoding Romans </b>

A program for encrypting and decrypting text by a simple character shift. It works by producing all possible combinations.

<b> Loading </b>

It's a loading bar. It does not stop...

<b> Toothpicks </b>

A simple rule set of placing down toothpicks creating a nice pattern. The rule is that tootpicks must be placed on the ends of other toothpicks if there is space and that defines the next itteration in the pattern.

still more descriptions to do.
